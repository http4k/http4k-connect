# AzureAI

### Installation

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("org.http4k:http4k-connect-bom:5.20.0.0"))
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-connect-ai-azure")
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-connect-ai-azure-fake")
}
```

The http4k-connect AzureAI integration provides:

- AzureAI API Client
- Compatibility with GitHub Models for testing, so you can use a GitHubToken instead of a deployed Azure model
- FakeAzureAI server which can be used as testing harness for either API Client or AzureAI plugins

## AzureAI API connector

The AzureAI connector provides the following Actions:

* ChatCompletion
* CreateEmbeddings

New actions can be created easily using the same transport.

The client APIs utilise the AzureAI API Key (Bearer Auth). There is no reflection used anywhere in the library, so
this is perfect for deploying to a Serverless function.

### Example usage

```kotlin
    // create a client
val client = AzureAI.Http(
    AzureAIApiKey.of("foobar"),
    AzureHost.of("myHost"), Region.of("us-east-1"),
    http.debug()
)

// all operations return a Result monad of the API type
val result: Result<Sequence<CompletionResponse>, RemoteFailure> = client
    .chatCompletion(ModelName.of("Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"), listOf(Message(User, "good afternoon")), 1000, true)

println(result.orThrow().toList())
}
```

Other examples can be found [here](https://github.com/http4k/http4k-connect/tree/master/azure/fake/src/examples/kotlin).

## Fake AzureAI Server

The Fake AzureAI provides the below actions and can be spun up as a server, meaning it is perfect for using in test
environments without using up valuable request tokens!

* ChatCompletion
* CreateEmbeddings
* 
### Security

The Fake server endpoints are secured with a BearerToken header, but the value is not checked for anything other than presence.

### Generation of responses

By default, a random LoremIpsum generator creates chat completion responses for the Fake. This behaviour can be
overridden to generate custom response formats (eg. structured responses) if required. To do so, create instances of
the `ChatCompletionGenerator` interface and return as appropriate.

### Default Fake port: 14504

To start:

```
FakeAzureAI().start()
```
